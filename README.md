# Full-Stack Web Developer Interview Project

## Introduction ðŸ“œ
The objective of this project is to demonstrate your capability in full-stack development by creating a web application.
This application will include a profile page where each user can see their posts.
The focus is on seamlessly connecting the frontend to the backend API for user management and presenting data through a clean and intuitive interface.


## Objectives ðŸŽ¯
Develop a small web application using React for the frontend and json-server to simulate the backend.
The application should feature a login section for user authentication and a profile page displaying user details along with their posts in chronological order.


## Requirements âœ…
 * Implement the frontend with React (Vite).
 * Use json-server to create a mock RESTful API with the provided data.json, containing predefined users and posts.
 * Include a login section to authenticate users based on the email and password from the users entity in the json-server backend.
 * After authentication, direct the user to a profile page showing their name and a list of their posts, ordered by date.


## Optional Features
 * Add functionality to add, edit, and remove posts.
 * Implement state management to preserve application state even after page refreshes.
 * Enhance the user interface and user experience with advanced design or frameworks. Feel free to extend the data.json file with additional fields if you find it necessary to support the application's features or improve its functionality.
 * Develop the project using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.


## Getting Started ðŸš€
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with npm install.
3. Launch the json-server backend using `npm run json-server`.
4. In a separate terminal, start the frontend with `npm run dev`.
Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and the backend at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)


## General Guidelines
 * The application should be responsive and adhere to web design and usability best practices.
 * Document the code clearly to explain the purpose and functionality of different sections.
 * Commit your changes incrementally to reflect the development history.

This project does not have a strict deadline. However, we recommend completing it within one week.
